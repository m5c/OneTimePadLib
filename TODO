-chunk - a series of random noise within the one time pad.
-chop - a message with exact size of chunk, can be encrypted or not.

missing functionality
- storage of bundled encrypted messages as object + convenient method to get next chunk for encryption. Maybe even append message method?
- serializeation of buneld encrypted messages for chat history purposes
- deserialization of bundled encrypted messages for load chat history purposes
- OTP deserialize option

Create a test where the OTP runs out of chunks (encryption and decryption)

To be removed: storage to disk of otp ( it think it already is only used in tests.)
